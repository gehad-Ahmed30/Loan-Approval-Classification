# 📊 Loan Approval Prediction using Credit Risk Dataset

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing and predicting loan approvals** using a **Credit Risk dataset**. The goal is to develop a **machine learning model** that helps financial institutions assess loan applicants' risk levels based on various factors such as income, credit history, employment status, and debt-to-income ratio.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and correlations in the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Training and evaluating models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Performance Metrics:** Using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for evaluation.
- **Deployment:** The model can be integrated into a web application for real-time loan approval predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains **various financial attributes** of loan applicants. It includes:
- **Applicant Income**
- **Credit Score**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Employment Status**
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**
- **Previous Loan Defaults**
