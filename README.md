# 📊 Loan Approval Prediction using Credit Risk Dataset  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing, processing, and predicting loan approvals** using a **Credit Risk dataset**. It leverages **Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning** techniques to assess applicants' credit risk based on financial factors like income, credit history, employment status, and debt-to-income ratio.  

## 📌 Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and correlations in the dataset.  
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models:** Implementing Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Deployment:** The model can be integrated into a web application for real-time loan approval predictions.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of **various financial attributes** of loan applicants, including:  
- **Applicant Income**  
- **Credit Score**  
- **Loan Amount**  
- **Employment Status**  
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**  
- **Previous Loan Defaults**  

This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate **loan approval prediction system** to support financial institutions in making data-driven decisions. 🚀
